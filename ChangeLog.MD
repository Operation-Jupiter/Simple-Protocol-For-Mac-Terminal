## Feb 22, 2018
Added SSH it is almost complete. Going to move ssh to a new swift file. 
All main.swift will do is register some of the commands.
Each protocol will have its own swift file.
Going to compile all of the swift files together with a good compiler.
EX: C, C#, C++, Ruby, Python, etc.
Main.swift will link that file to it so if user types ssh it will open file "ssh.swift"
